## Deprecated

Since version 1.10.0. Use {@purista/hono-http-server} instead.

The HttpServerService is a service which exposes commands of services as http endpoints.  
All exposed commands must be marked as exposed endpoints in the CommandBuilder.

While the main focus is on development and debug, the HttpServerService will also fit for small projects or running on IoT/edge.

Under the hood, [fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) is used as basement.  
Because of this, the whole [fastify ecosystem](https://www.fastify.io/ecosystem/) can be used and integrated.

The HttpServerService can also be configured, to provide the OpenApi-UI in browsers.  
The OpenApi definitions is created from the CommandBuilder settings of each command.  
This means, that there are no additional steps or code required, to provide the OpenApi definition.  
It is autogenerated mostly from input and output schema definitions.

## Example

```typescript
import fastifyStatic from '@fastify/static'
import { DefaultEventBridge, gracefulShutdown, initLogger } from '@purista/core'
import { httpServerV1Service, HttpServerServiceV1Config } from '@purista/httpserver'

const main = async() => {
 const logger = initLogger()

 const eventBridge = new DefaultEventBridge()

 const httpServerConfig: HttpServerServiceV1Config = {
   fastify: {},
   port: 8080,
   logLevel: 'debug',
   domain: 'localhost',
   apiMountPath: '/api',
   openApi: {
     enabled: true,
     info: {
       title: 'backend api',
       description: 'OpenApi definition for server endpoints',
       version: '1.0.0',
     },
   },
 }

 const httpServerService = await httpServerV1Service.getInstance(eventBridge, {
   serviceConfig: httpServerConfig,
 })

 // static file handler
 const defaultPublicPath = resolve(__dirname, '..', 'public')
 httpServerService.server?.register(fastifyStatic, {
   root: defaultPublicPath,
   decorateReply: false,
 })

 // start the webserver
 await httpServerService.start()

 // and and start your services here
 // ...
 // ...

 gracefulShutdown(logger, [
   // begin with the event bridge to no longer accept incoming messages
   eventBridge,
   // shut down optional services
   // ...
   // ...
   httpServerService,
 ])
}

main()
```
