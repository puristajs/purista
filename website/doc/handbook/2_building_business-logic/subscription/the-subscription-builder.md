# The subscription builder

## Guards & Transformers

Subscriptions have the same transform and hook options as commands.

See chapter [Transformer & Guards](../command/the-command-builder.md).

There are only slightly differences in some of the builder methods.
For example, setting the output schema requires an event name in addition to the schema.
