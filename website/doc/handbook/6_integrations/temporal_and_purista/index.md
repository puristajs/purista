# Temporal and PURISTA

Imagine building an application like crafting a masterpiece.  
Each part plays a crucial role, yet they must work harmoniously together.  

That's where PURISTA comes in.  
With PURISTA, your application becomes a collection of independent, isolated functions—like individual brushstrokes on a canvas. These functions are designed to work seamlessly, triggering reactions and creating smooth flows within your application.

However, every masterpiece needs a guiding hand, especially when it comes to managing time-based tasks or handling long-running processes. This is where Temporal steps onto the stage.

Temporal is more than just software — it's a powerful tool that allows you to define, run, and observe your application's workflows as elegant lines of code.  
Think of it as the conductor orchestrating a symphony of functions.

By combining the simplicity of PURISTA with the sophistication of Temporal, you can create truly remarkable applications.  
Whether it's arranging your isolated functions into complex scenarios or ensuring smooth transitions between different parts of your application, Temporal empowers you to bring your vision to life.
