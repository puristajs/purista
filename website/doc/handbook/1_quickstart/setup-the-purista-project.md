# Setup a PURISTA project

In this short quickstart example, we will setup a new project, based on PURISTA.

Create a new project folder and navigate into the new folder.

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
```

If you have already installed the PURISTA CLI globally you can simply run `purista init`.  
Otherwise, you can do `npx @purista/cli init`.

Please follow the steps in the installation process.
It is recommended to install the PURISTA CLI globally.
