The application can:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>deploy to IoT/edge</li>\\n<li>deploy as monolithic instances</li>\\n<li>deploy in microservice style on Kubernetes</li>\\n<li>deploy as serverless functions (FaaS) at different cloud vendors.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<div class=\\"hint-container tip\\">\\n<p class=\\"hint-container-title\\">Awesome!</p>\\n<p><strong>All this is possible From one code base, with no or low overhead and without touching the business logic!</strong><br>\\nSee: <a href=\\"/handbook/7._deployment/0_deployment.html\\" target=\\"blank\\">Deployment in handbook</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<p><img src=\\"/graphic/advertise_large.svg\\" alt=\\"PURISTA typescript Framework 1.5\\"></p>\\n<p>You can also follow news on twitter <strong><a href=\\"https://twitter.com/purista_js\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">@purista_js</a></strong> and get direct in touch at the <strong><a href=\\"https://discord.gg/9feaUm3H2v\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Discord Chat</a></strong>.</p>\\n<p>PURISTA has now a CLI tool, which will help to set up a project and speed up the creation of new services, commands, and subscriptions.<br>\\nThe biggest addition in version 1.5 is the integration of <a href=\\"https://opentelemetry.io\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">OpenTelemetry</a> into the core functionality of PURISTA.</p>\\n<p>Subscriptions have been overhauled and are now aligned to commands. You have now the same functionality for in- and output transformations and hooks. Starting with version 1.5, subscriptions can return results, which will be published as custom event messages.</p>\\n<p>PURISTA version 1.5, introduces stores for configurations, states, and secrets. They are interfaces in the context of commands and subscriptions. This allows drop-in replacements for specific vendor solutions, without touching your business logic.</p>\\n<p>The first infrastructure-focused SDK <code>@purista/k8s-sdk</code> is available now, which will help developers, to deploy their applications in microservice style on <a href=\\"https://kubernetes.io\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Kubernetes</a>.</p>\\n<p>In addition to bug fixes, type, and documentation improvements, a set of breaking changes and name changes are coming with version 1.5. This was necessary to unify and improve naming and simplify constructors and method calls.</p>\\n"}`);export{e as data};
