The service function A invokes a service function B.<br> Service function A is returning a result back to the frontend. There is also a subscription C which listens for success responses of service A.</p><p>The traceId will be the same for all the messages and responses between the frontend, different service functions and subscriptions.</p><p>This allows to track the whole flow.</p><h3 id="instanceid" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#instanceid" aria-hidden="true">#</a> instanceId</h3><p>The instance id is the unique id of the current event bridge (client) instance. This id is auto generated by default, but can be set as config parameter. This id might be used by some event bridge adapter.<br> It can also be used for monitoring.</p><h3 id="correlationid" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#correlationid" aria-hidden="true">#</a> correlationId</h3><p>The correlation id is a unique id that is used for a request (command) message and the corresponding response. While the traceId stays the same for a whole process flow, the correlationId is only valid and used for a single call.</p><h3 id="id-message-id" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#id-message-id" aria-hidden="true">#</a> id (message id)</h3><p>Each message has a unique id, which might be used by the underlying event bridge/infrastructure or for persistence purposes.</p><h3 id="principalid" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#principalid" aria-hidden="true">#</a> principalId</h3><p>The principal id is an optional field, which can be set by business logic to the user id.<br> The principal id should be some technical user id and not something like an email, as it might be logged.<br> It is recommended to use the message principal id for any authentication/authorization, because this way, there is no need to look into the message payload, which might be encrypted or not present.</p><p>The principal id is propagated down - like the trace id - in the whole process flow. So it will be available in subscriptions and function invocations. Each message has a unique id, which might be used by the underlying event bridge/infrastructure or for persistence purposes.</p><h3 id="tenantid" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tenantid" aria-hidden="true">#</a> tenantId</h3><p>The tenant id is an optional field, which can be set by business logic to the tenant id.<br> The principal id should be some technical tenant id and not something like an company name, as it might be logged.</p><p>The tenant id is propagated down - like the principal id - in the whole process flow. So it will be available in subscriptions and function invocations.
