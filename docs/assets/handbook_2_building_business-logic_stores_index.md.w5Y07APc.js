This ensures, that the actual business implementation is decoupled and isolated.</p><p>When considering separation of concerns, PURISTA offers three types of stores. While they share similar APIs, each store type is tailored to address specific use cases.</p><h2 id="config-store" tabindex="-1">Config store <a class="header-anchor" href="#config-store" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Config store&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The config store serves as a repository for storing and retrieving technical configurations. For instance, you might store the URL of a third-party provider here, allowing commands or subscriptions to access this information when needed, such as in the <a href="./../fetch_based_http_client.html">HttpClient</a>.</p><h2 id="secret-store" tabindex="-1">Secret store <a class="header-anchor" href="#secret-store" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Secret store&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The secret store is designed to safeguard confidential and private data. For instance, if your HTTP request to a third-party provider requires API keys for authentication and authorization, it&#39;s essential to store your personal API key securely in the secret store.</p><h2 id="state-store" tabindex="-1">State store <a class="header-anchor" href="#state-store" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;State store&quot;">​</a></h2><p>State stores are tasked with managing the business states of your application. In PURISTA, commands and subscriptions are designed to be stateless, operating within a distributed system. If, for example, you require user sessions, you would utilize the state store to store session information.</p>',9),i=[a];function n(d,c,h,l,u,p){return s(),t("div",null,i)}const m=e(r,[["render",n]]);export{_ as __pageData,m as default};
