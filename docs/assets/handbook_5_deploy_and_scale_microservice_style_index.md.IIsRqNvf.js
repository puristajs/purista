We call it here <em>microservice style</em>, as classical microservices are typically (more or less) directly communicating via HTTP. In PURISTA, the communication is not a direct connection between two instances - it is done via a message broker. Because of this, service mesh software like <a href="https://istio.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Istio</a> can&#39;t be simply used. Here, you might want to consider <a href="https://dapr.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">dapr</a>.</p><p>This solution fits if you have multiple developer teams, which should be able to work (and scale) independently. This is the <strong>biggest PRO</strong> in comparison to the monolithic approach: It enables scaling the whole project and not only some software instances.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="example"></p><p>This solution will need the effort to set up, configure and maintain. You will also quickly hit the point, where you will need additional third-party solutions to handle the bigger complexity. Here, a common way is, the usage of <a href="https://kubernetes.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">kubernetes</a>. These third-party solutions will also bring a lot of additional benefits. The range will be from &quot;some nicer UI&quot; up to &quot;autoscaling services&quot; and automated, reproducible deployment. The costs, for running a system this way, are (mostly) predictable - similar to the monolithic approach.</p><p>The overall workload is distributed across all running instances and the number of running instances per service can be set differently. If you have for example some service, which does some time-consuming computation, it might make sense to have more instances running.</p>',6),d=e('<p>In case, you are using the <code>@purista/httpserver</code> package, keep in mind, that the instances should be started before all other services or the API routing table must be provided as config.
