Especially in cloud environments, you &quot;simply&quot; add more ressources &amp; instances.</p><p>If you&#39;re looking into some IoT or edge scenario, scaling means something different.<br> The ressources of a single edge device is fixed and cant simply be upgraded. You might have hundereds or thousend devices with fixed ressources providing raw data.</p><p>One option is, to collect the raw data of all your devices, send them to your server/cloud.<br> This works, but wastes a lot of ressources for data transmition and handling on the server side. While leaving ressources on the edge device unused.<br> A better approach is, to prepare the data on every edge device for further processing. This prepeared data is most likely much smaller than raw data and reduces the amount of computation on the server side.<br> Also things like unstable data connection, caching and so on will become important at some point.</p><p>With the concept of services with single, independent commands and subscriptions, you can simply decide how a single instance of your application should look like.<br> It is possible to run some services only on the edge device, some services only on the cloud and some of them on both sides.<br> This means, scaling becomes more a decision &quot;where is the best place to do it&quot;.</p><p>Running software built with PURISTA on edge devices is quite simple and does not need special handling.</p><p>There are in general 2 options.</p><h2 id="_100-on-edge-device" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_100-on-edge-device" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 100% on edge device</h2><p>The first approach is, to run a single instance of your application and use the <code>DefaultEventBridge</code> of <code>@purista/core</code> package.

This means lower resource consumption and no software dependency.</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="single instance"></p><p>The downside of this approach is, that you need to somehow share the data with your server or cloud instances.<br> One way would be, that you provide some kind of API and the server is pulling the data from your devices.<br> A other option would be, that you create a subscription or a cron job, which is sending data to your cloud.
